My project showcases movies, series, and music on the frontend. Each of these categories has its dedicated page. For instance, on the movies page, users can filter by genre, and the same applies to series and music.
The project features a search function and a user sign-in section. Users can type the name of a movie, series, or song, and the relevant content will appear in the search results.
There is also a user sign-in section and There's an "Account" section where users can see their details. There's an "Admin Panel" in my project.
Admin can update, delete or add new content of movies, series or music after logging in.
The backend is developed with Node.js. On the frontend, React is used. Third-party libraries include react-router-dom and alertifyjs. Styling is done using TailwindCSS. For the backend, Express.js and nodemon are the primary tools.
